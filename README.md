This repository contains files from the Coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data. In particular, the final project which creates a tidy data set based on the information released from Samsung about exercises located at this website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The R script in this repository will:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
